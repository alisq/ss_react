Through the lens of architecture and urban design, students will investigate models of mutual aid, intentional communities, and transitional housing for unhoused populations. The course examines zoning challenges, adaptive reuse strategies, and community partnerships that enable churches to serve as housing stewards. Studio projects and case studies will engage students in designing dignified, low-barrier housing on underutilized land—where design becomes a tool for repair, equity, and belonging. This is architecture in service of both place and people.</p>",

We apply new principles of architectural project design to issues of urban design, zoning and planning, developer economics, and the roles and responsibilities of housing development to \"give back to the city\".We believe now that public space in urban development is the key. Rather than site-selfish development, mono-programming, demographic targeting, expedient circulation and infrastructure, and \"look at me' stylistic flex, we believe urban housing has to be public-first, a compositionally balanced collage of the modern urban condition.</p>",

By definition, cities are meant to be lived in, but the conditions of their habitability are changing. There are more and more of us, and housing often has the status of a commodity. Because the role of the architectural project is precisely to envisage different scenarios of life through the built environment, it has the capacity to influence, upstream, the future of our cities and their neighborhoods, and to contribute fundamentally to the overall quality of urban life. Thinking and building architecture to inhabit the city looks at architecture from this perspective, with a particular focus on Montreal’s Quartier Namur-Hippodrome.</p>",

Together, we will “dare to dream,” building on historical social housing projects like Cooperativa Palo Alto and on radical contemporary housing proposals, such as the Squamish Nation’s Sen̓áḵw.
